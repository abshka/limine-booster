#
# Configuration for limine-booster
#
# This tool is designed to be zero-config and will automatically:
# - Detect your kernel command line from /proc/cmdline
# - Create Limine entries for all installed kernels in /+Arch Linux section
# - Support both standard and AUR kernels
# - Generate Booster initramfs entries
#
# These options allow advanced users to customize the behavior.
#

# CPU Microcode Integration
# Set to "yes" to automatically detect and include CPU microcode
# (intel-ucode.img or amd-ucode.img) as a module in all kernel entries.
ENABLE_MICROCODE="yes"

# Kernel Command Line Override
# By default, the kernel command line is auto-detected from /proc/cmdline.
# Set this to override with a custom command line for all kernel entries.
# Leave empty to use auto-detection.
#
# Example: CMDLINE_OVERRIDE="root=UUID=12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc rw quiet"
CMDLINE_OVERRIDE=""
